## Free API Limitations

The free tier of football-data.org API has some limitations:
- Limited competitions available
- Rate limiting (10 requests per minute)
- Historical data may be limited

For production use, consider upgrading to a paid plan for more comprehensive data access.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch competitions" error
- Check that your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
- Verify your API key is valid at football-data.org
- Check your internet connection

### "These teams have never faced off" message
